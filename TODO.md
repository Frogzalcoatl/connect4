# TODO

* Ensure all UI functionality isnt dependent on connect4 specific files (ex: screens/.c, connect4.c) so it can be reused for future projects
* Number input UIElement
* Slider UIElement
* Settings screen
* Support for adjustable board size and "amount in row to win" (i cant think of a better way to word this rn)
* Board UI
* An animated background (1:1 aspect ratio, aligned to center)
* Background music
* Improve win check efficiency (see WINCHECKCRITIQUE.md)
* Improve sound design
* Use the TTF text engine thingy thingy instead of current text implementation

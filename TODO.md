# TODO

* Fix button logic. Whilepressed doesnt seem to be working properly. Also check on other callback types
* Fix OnCancel to use the same logic as runbackbutton or whatever its called.
* Simplify ui element configs. Maybe even try to get the functions to only a few parameters and not even use config structs
* Add border radius. Store properties in the same way css does.
* Implement SDL_image
* Notification ui element
    * Do this one first bc the whole timed fade in / slide animation thing might require some new stuff that can be applied to other ui elements.
* Popup ui element
* Slider UIElement
* Dropdown ui element
* Board UI
* Turn time limits
* Computer player with different difficulty levels
* Improve win check efficiency (see WINCHECKCRITIQUE.md)
* Improve UI cleanliness once code is done
    * Maybe read that ui book xsku sent you
* Animated background
* Background music
* Improve sound design
* Haptics?
* Online Multiplayer?

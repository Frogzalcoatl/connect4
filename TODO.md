# TODO

* Look in to android compiler warnings (the ones relating to java stuff)
* Separate layout calculation from drawing
* Drawing Circles
* Proper mouse detection for different shapes/rotations
* Notification ui element
    * Do this one first bc the whole timed fade in / slide animation thing might require some new stuff that can be applied to other ui elements.
* Popup ui element
* Slider UIElement
* Dropdown ui element
* Look in to using SDL mixer (for audio) and SDL image (For better symbols. Maybe an image ui element)
* Use the new ui logic to remake the ui
    * Separate desktop and touch ui layouts. Can switch between them in settings via UI Profile or smth (Similar to mc bedrock)
* Improve asset bundling. Maybe automatically assign data to arrays with the array name being their folder name or smth autmatically generate an enum as well.
    * (ex: C4_Assets_Images[C4_Assets_Images_Icon_png])
* Board UI
* Turn time limits
* Improve win check efficiency (see WINCHECKCRITIQUE.md)
* Improve UI cleanliness once code is done
    * Maybe read that ui book xsku sent you
* Computer player with different difficulty levels
* Animated background (1:1 aspect ratio, aligned to center)
* Background music
* Improve sound design

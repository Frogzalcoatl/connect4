# TODO

* Look in to making a screen struct
* Z indexing
* Implement ui element stacks. They would be similar to button groups, except for any element type
* Keyboard cursor (Use arrow keys to navigate buttons)
    * Can also be used to track whether the keyboard is focused on text boxes, etc
* Slider UIElement
* Dropdown ui element
* Board UI
* Turn time limits
* Use glyphs for fonts so you dont have to reload textures for every text element
* Look in to using SDL mixer (for audio) and SDL image (For better symbols. Maybe an image ui element)
* Improve win check efficiency (see WINCHECKCRITIQUE.md)
* Improve UI cleanliness once code is done
* Animated background (1:1 aspect ratio, aligned to center)
* Background music
* Improve sound design

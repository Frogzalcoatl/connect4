# TODO

* Implement SDL_mixer
* Implement SDL_image
* Should you still use sdl_ttf considering the warning shown in the console during compilation?
* Notification ui element
    * Do this one first bc the whole timed fade in / slide animation thing might require some new stuff that can be applied to other ui elements.
* Popup ui element
* Slider UIElement
* Dropdown ui element
* Improve asset bundling. Maybe automatically assign data to arrays with the array name being their folder name or smth autmatically generate an enum as well.
    * (ex: C4_Assets_Images_Data[C4_Assets_Images_Icon_png] and C4_Assets_Images_Size[C4_Assets_Images_Icon_png])
* Board UI
* Turn time limits
* Improve win check efficiency (see WINCHECKCRITIQUE.md)
* Improve UI cleanliness once code is done
    * Maybe read that ui book xsku sent you
* Computer player with different difficulty levels
* Animated background
* Background music

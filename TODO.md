# TODO

* Z indexing (Support nested containers)
* Implement ui element stacks. They would be similar to button groups, except for any element type. Maybe call them containers instead.
    * Consider deleting button groups after these are implemented
* Keyboard cursor (Use arrow keys to navigate buttons)
    * Can also be used to track whether the keyboard is focused on text boxes, etc
* Slider UIElement
* Dropdown ui element
* Separate desktop and touch ui layouts. Can switch between them in settings via UI Profile or smth (Similar to mc bedrock)
* Improve asset bundling. Maybe automatically assign data to arrays with the array name being their folder name or smth autmatically generate an enum as well. (ex: C4_Assets_Images[C4_Assets_Images_Icon])
* Board UI
* Turn time limits
* Use glyphs for fonts so you dont have to reload textures for every text element
* Look in to using SDL mixer (for audio) and SDL image (For better symbols. Maybe an image ui element)
* Improve win check efficiency (see WINCHECKCRITIQUE.md)
* Improve UI cleanliness once code is done
* Animated background (1:1 aspect ratio, aligned to center)
* Background music
* Improve sound design
